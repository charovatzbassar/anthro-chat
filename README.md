# AnthroChat
> AnthroChat is an application which focuses on connecting people, and brings the idea of social networking back to its roots.
> In AnthroChat, users register, and can join chatrooms of their interest to meet like-minded peers.
> 
> AnthroChat's client is built using React Native with Expo and TypeScript. It is further accompanied with
> * React Navigation for screen routing
> * Tanstack Query for data fetching and state management
> * Redux for global state management
> * Formik and Yup for form management and validation
>   
> On the backend, the REST API was created using Express.js. The chat server itself utilises Socket.IO for real-time communication between clients. It is further accompanied with:
> * Mongoose for modeling and fetching data from a Mongo instance
> * JWT authentication
>   
> The code itself utilises all the best practices and architectural patterns.
